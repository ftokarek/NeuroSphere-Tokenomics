## üéØ **THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY**

**We're building the "Pump.fun for AI Prompts" - combining proven token trading demand with real utility**

- **Ask:** $500K for 15% equity
- **Market:** $62B+ addressable (pump.fun daily volume √ó 365)
- **Business Model:** 0.2% trading fees (10x lower than pump.fun's 1%)
- **Projected ROI:** 8-38x returns in 3-5 years (conservative scenarios)

---

## üí° **THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING**

**Pump.fun generates $1.7M daily revenue from pure speculation with zero utility:**
- $170M daily trading volume on tokens with no use case
- High 1% fees limit adoption and trading volume
- Regulatory risk from pure speculation focus
- Market fatigue - traders want utility beyond hype cycles

**The opportunity:** Apply pump.fun's proven model to functional AI prompts that people actually use.

### Core Innovation:
1. **Tokenize Functional AI Prompts** (ChatGPT, image gen, video creation)
