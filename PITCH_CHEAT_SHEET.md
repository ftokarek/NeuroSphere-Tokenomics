## üí° **ELEVATOR PITCH** (60 seconds)
*"Pump.fun has proven there's massive demand for token creation platforms - $170 million in daily trading volume. But their tokens have zero utility, just pure speculation.*

*We're applying the exact same model to AI prompts that people actually use. Create a prompt for ChatGPT, mint it as a token, trade it on our platform. When someone wants to use your prompt, they burn a token - reducing supply and creating real scarcity.*

*Our fees are 10x lower than pump.fun's, we have real utility driving demand, and we're first to market in AI prompt tokenization. We're targeting just 2% of pump.fun's volume, which would generate $15.7 million in annual revenue by Year 3.*

*We need $500K for 15% equity to launch in the next few weeks and capture this opportunity before major platforms copy us. Conservative projections show 38x returns for investors in 3 years.*

*The question isn't whether AI tokenization will happen - it's whether you want to be part of the first successful platform."*

## ‚ùì **ANTICIPATED Q&A**

### "How do you know people will use this?"
- **Answer:** "Pump.fun's ‚Ç¨170M daily volume proves demand for token trading. PromptBase proves demand for AI prompts. We're combining proven markets."

### "What if OpenAI builds their own marketplace?"
- **Answer:** "We have 12-18 months first-mover advantage. By then we'll have network effects and user loyalty. Plus, we're Web3 native - they'd have to rebuild everything."

### "How do you acquire users?"
- **Answer:** "Crypto-native marketing: influencer partnerships, airdrops, referral programs. Our 10x lower fees vs pump.fun will drive organic migration."

### "What about regulatory risk?"
- **Answer:** "Utility tokens face less regulatory risk than pure speculation. We're proactively building EU compliance from day one."

### "Why now?"
- **Answer:** "Perfect storm: AI adoption exploding, Web3 infrastructure mature, pump.fun proving market demand, but no one's combined them yet."

## üöÄ **CLOSING STATEMENTS**

### Option 1 (Confident):
*"We're going to build this whether you invest or not. The question is whether you want to be part of the 38x returns when we capture 2% of a ‚Ç¨62 billion market."*

### Option 2 (Partnership):
*"We'd love to have you as partners, not just investors. Your network in EU crypto could accelerate our timeline to break-even by 6 months."*

### Option 3 (Urgency):
*"Our MVP launches in 2 weeks. We're filling this round quickly to capitalize on our first-mover advantage. Can we count on you for ‚Ç¨50K-200K in this round?"*
