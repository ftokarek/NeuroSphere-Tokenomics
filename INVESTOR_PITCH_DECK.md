## Investor Pitch Deck - September 17, 2025

**🎯 The Ask: $500K for 15% Equity**  
**📍 Target: EU Crypto/Web3 Investors**  
**⏰ Pitch Duration: 10 minutes + Q&A**

---

## Slide 1: The Problem - Pump.fun Without Purpose

### **$62M Daily Market with Zero Utility**

- **Pump.fun generates $1.7M daily revenue** from pure speculation
- **No real use case** - tokens exist only for trading
- **High 1% fees** limit trading volume and adoption
- **Regulatory risk** from securities concerns on pure speculation
- **Market fatigue** - traders want utility beyond hype cycles

> *"We've proven the demand for token creation platforms. Now it's time to add real value."*

---

## Slide 2: Our Solution - Pump.fun + Real AI Utility

### **NeuroSphere = Trading Platform + Functional AI Prompts**

🧠 **Tokenize Functional AI Prompts**
- ChatGPT prompts, image generation, video creation
- Each prompt becomes a tradeable token with fixed supply
- Real utility: people actually use these prompts

🔥 **Burn Mechanism Creates Scarcity**
- Using a prompt burns one token
- Reduces total supply over time
- Creates natural price appreciation pressure

💰 **10x Lower Fees Drive Volume**
- 0.2% vs pump.fun's 1%
- More trading, more revenue, more adoption

🏛️ **NST Governance Token**
- 30% of platform fees distributed to stakers
- Governance rights and exclusive features
- Sustainable tokenomics with real value accrual
